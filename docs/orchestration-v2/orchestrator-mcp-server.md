# Orchestrator MCP Server

## Purpose

T3 exposes V2 orchestration through its app-owned MCP endpoint. A provider
agent can use this endpoint to:

- create an app-owned sub-agent on any supported provider instance;
- wait for or poll the sub-agent's durable result;
- cancel an active delegated task; and
- create one or more ordinary top-level T3 threads;
- list and incrementally read project threads;
- send or steer follow-up messages; and
- wait for or interrupt ordinary thread runs.

These are T3 orchestration operations, not provider-native sub-agent APIs.
Delegated tasks always create a T3 child thread and run. The child receives
only the supplied task prompt, plus an optional role instruction supplied in
the same tool call. Parent conversation history is not copied into the child.

`ThreadManagementService` is the shared server application boundary for V2
WebSocket commands and MCP. It owns project-scoped lookup, listing, send-mode
selection, durable send postconditions, wait polling, and interrupt selection;
`OrchestratorV2` remains the lower-level command/event processor. Transport
adapters only authenticate, resolve transport-specific inputs, and shape
responses.

## Transport And Authentication

The orchestration tools share the existing authenticated HTTP MCP endpoint:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:<server-port>/mcp
```

The provider-visible server key is `t3-code`. The endpoint registers both the
preview toolkit and the orchestration toolkit.

Before `ProviderSessionManager` opens a new V2 provider session, it asks
`McpSessionRegistry` for a credential scoped to:

- the T3 environment;
- the parent T3 thread;
- the concrete provider instance; and
- the provider session.

The credential grants `preview` and `orchestration` capabilities. Credentials
expire after a maximum lifetime, expire when idle, and are revoked when the
provider session is released. The raw token is not persisted in orchestration
state.

The MCP HTTP server resolves the bearer token and supplies the resulting
`McpInvocationScope` to tool handlers. Orchestration handlers additionally
check the `orchestration` capability before reading or mutating state.

## Provider Injection

### Codex V2

Codex app-server receives the remote MCP server through command-line config
overrides:

```text
-c mcp_servers.t3-code.url=http://127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp
-c mcp_servers.t3-code.bearer_token_env_var="T3_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN"
```

The provider-session token is placed in `T3_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN`. Both the
production Codex launcher and the injectable test launcher use the same
projection helper.

### Claude Agent SDK V2

Claude receives an HTTP MCP server in its query options:

```ts
{
  mcpServers: {
    "t3-code": {
      type: "http",
      url: "http://127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp",
      headers: {
        Authorization: "Bearer <provider-session-token>",
      },
    },
  },
  allowedTools: [
    // existing allowed tools
    "mcp__t3-code__*",
  ],
}
```

The adapter logs only whether MCP configuration exists; it does not log the
server headers or token.

### Cursor Agent SDK V2

Cursor receives the same authenticated HTTP MCP endpoint through the SDK's
`mcpServers` agent and send options. The adapter passes the authorization header
to the SDK but projects only redacted option metadata into protocol diagnostics.

### Grok ACP V2

Grok receives the authenticated HTTP MCP endpoint through the ACP
`session/new`, `session/load`, and `session/fork` `mcpServers` field. The shared
ACP adapter owns standard protocol behavior; the Grok flavor adds xAI extension
requests such as structured user questions.

ACP does not define native subagents or active steering. Grok therefore uses
orchestrator-owned child threads and implements steering through
cancel-and-restart. Its current driver also lacks `session/fork`, so app forks
use portable context transfer. These are orchestrator policies, not
provider-specific MCP tools.

### ACP Registry V2

The `acpRegistry` driver is the generic flavor of the same shared ACP adapter.
Each provider instance names an agent from the official ACP Registry. At
session startup the driver resolves the current platform distribution, uses a
managed binary cache or the declared `npx`/`uvx` package, and then negotiates
standard ACP capabilities during `initialize`. A local executable may override
the managed command without changing the registry-declared arguments or
environment.

Capabilities such as session loading, session forking, models, modes, and MCP
transport are enabled only when the selected agent advertises them. Missing
features degrade through V2 policy: steering uses interrupt-and-restart,
forking uses portable context when native `session/fork` is unavailable, and
subagents use orchestrator-owned child threads. Registry agents do not receive
provider-specific extensions; those remain in flavors such as Grok.

### Initial Provider Support

The V2 provider adapters are Codex, Claude Agent SDK, Cursor Agent SDK, and
Grok plus generic registry agents over ACP.
Capability discovery still reports other registered provider instances, but marks them
unavailable for orchestration when no V2 adapter exists. This keeps provider
selection model-visible without allowing a request that cannot run.

## Tool Surface

The server exposes eleven orchestration tools.

### `orchestrator_capabilities`

Returns:

- the inherited provider instance and model;
- the parent runtime and interaction modes;
- registered provider instances and advertised models;
- whether each provider can run a child task; and
- feature flags for polling, cancellation, and batch thread creation.

Unavailable providers include model-visible constraints such as missing V2
adapter support, disabled state, missing executable, or missing authentication.

### `delegate_task`

Creates a T3-owned child thread and immediately dispatches the supplied task
prompt.

```ts
type DelegateTaskInput = {
  task: string;
  target?: {
    providerInstanceId?: string;
    driverKind?: string;
    model?: string;
  };
  title?: string;
  role?: "implementation" | "research" | "review" | "design" | "test" | "general";
  mode?: "async" | "wait";
  timeoutMs?: number;
  clientRequestId?: string;
  runtimeMode?: "inherit" | "approval-required" | "auto-accept-edits" | "full-access";
  interactionMode?: "inherit" | "plan" | "default";
};
```

Provider, model, runtime mode, and interaction mode inherit from the parent
when omitted. Selecting a different provider without a model uses that
provider's first advertised model.

Delegation requires an active parent run owned by the MCP credential's
provider session. The request becomes the V2 command
`delegated_task.request`.

`mode: "async"` returns the current durable state immediately.
`mode: "wait"` polls the same durable state until it becomes terminal or the
timeout expires. A wait timeout does not cancel the child; the result sets
`waitTimedOut: true`, and the caller can continue with `task_status`.

```ts
type DelegateTaskResult = {
  taskId: string;
  childThreadId: string;
  childRunId: string | null;
  childNodeId: string;
  status: "queued" | "running" | "waiting" | "completed" | "failed" | "cancelled" | "interrupted";
  providerInstanceId: string;
  model: string | null;
  summary: string | null;
  resultContextTransferId: string | null;
  waitTimedOut: boolean;
};
```

### `task_status`

Reads a delegated task from the parent thread's durable projection. A task ID
from another parent thread is rejected. Terminal results include the child
summary and the durable `subagent_result` context transfer ID when available.

### `task_cancel`

Interrupts the active child run through the normal V2 `run.interrupt` command.
It is idempotent for terminal tasks and accepts an optional cancellation
reason.

### `create_threads`

Creates between one and twenty ordinary top-level T3 threads:

```ts
type CreateThreadsInput = {
  threads: Array<{
    prompt?: string;
    title?: string;
    target?: {
      providerInstanceId?: string;
      driverKind?: string;
      model?: string;
    };
    runtimeMode?: "inherit" | "approval-required" | "auto-accept-edits" | "full-access";
    interactionMode?: "inherit" | "plan" | "default";
  }>;
  clientRequestId?: string;
};
```

Each entry independently resolves provider, model, and modes. The new threads
inherit the parent's project, branch, and worktree path, but they have no
sub-agent lineage. Entries with a prompt immediately dispatch a run; entries
without a prompt remain idle.

### `t3_thread_start`

Creates one ordinary top-level thread and immediately dispatches its first
prompt. It is the single-thread convenience form of `create_threads` and
returns the created thread and run IDs. Use `clientRequestId` when a caller may
retry the request.

### `t3_thread_list`

Lists durable thread shells in the calling thread's project, newest first.
Callers can filter by title, run status, and whether app-owned sub-agent threads
are included. Results are bounded and offset-paginated. Deleted threads and
threads from other projects are never exposed.

### `t3_thread_read`

Reads a project-scoped thread's durable state, recent runs, and visible
timeline. The default `messages` view returns user messages, assistant
messages, and proposed plans. The `activity` view also returns summarized tool,
reasoning, checkpoint, handoff, and runtime-request items. Large item text is
bounded and reports whether it was truncated. `afterPosition` and
`nextPosition` support incremental reads.

Thread and message results include required `createdBy` and `creationSource`
provenance. MCP-created threads and user-role messages use `createdBy: "agent"`
and `creationSource: "mcp"`; provider output uses `creationSource: "provider"`.
Actor and ingress are separate so agent-authored user-role messages remain
distinguishable from human-authored messages.

### `t3_thread_send`

Sends a message to an ordinary or delegated thread in the calling project:

- `auto` starts an idle thread, steers a fully active turn, or queues behind a
  turn that is not yet steerable;
- `queue` creates a separate follow-up run after active work;
- `steer` requires a steerable active provider turn; and
- `restart` requires an active provider turn and uses the orchestrator's
  interrupt-and-restart path.

The target runtime and interaction modes may not be broader than the caller's.
Stable command and message IDs are derived from `clientRequestId` for
idempotent retries.

### `t3_thread_wait`

Waits for a selected run to become `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`,
`interrupted`, or `rolled_back`. Without `runId`, it pins the latest run at call
time; an idle thread returns immediately. A timeout reports the latest durable
status and does not cancel work.

### `t3_thread_interrupt`

Interrupts a selected active run through the normal V2 `run.interrupt` command.
Without `runId`, it selects the newest interruptible run. A terminal run is
returned unchanged, and a thread with no active provider turn returns
`no_active_run`.

### Conversation forks and transfer discovery

`t3_thread_fork` dispatches the existing `thread.fork` command through
`ThreadManagementService`, including its project admission and deleted-source
checks. The request names a stable source point and supplies an idempotency key;
the target thread ID and command ID are stable for that key. The response is
derived from the committed `thread.created` and `context-transfer.created`
events rather than an optional final projection read.

Fork creation records lineage and a pending context transfer. Native eligibility
is reported from the source provider session and strong provider refs, but
resolution remains deferred to the first target turn. The existing provider
turn planner then chooses native fork or checks portable-context capabilities.

`t3_thread_transfers` exposes a bounded, newest-first view of one current-project
thread's durable context-transfer records. It is the read path for fork
provenance and later resolution or consumption.

`t3_thread_merge_back` validates that the source is a fork of the selected
target and that its explicit source run is provider-finished before dispatching
`thread.merge_back`. The committed transfer records both the selected result
point and the original fork base. It stays pending until the target's next turn;
a newer pending merge-back for the same pair supersedes the older transfer.
The target runtime and interaction modes may not exceed the calling thread's
captured or current ceiling. Stable request keys replay the same accepted
command receipt and transfer before re-evaluating mutable lineage, lifecycle, or
run state. This operation does not invoke Git or change workspace state.

## Delegated Task Lifecycle

The MCP server is a command ingress into V2. It does not call provider adapters
directly.

```text
provider model
  -> MCP tools/call delegate_task
  -> authenticated OrchestratorMcpService
  -> shared ThreadManagementService
  -> V2 delegated_task.request command
  -> child thread + child run
  -> parent app_owned subagent projection
  -> parent/child execution nodes
  -> consumed subagent_spawn context transfer
  -> normal provider effect and runtime ingestion
  -> child run reaches a terminal state
  -> parent subagent/node/turn item finalized
  -> consumed subagent_result context transfer
  -> wait result or later task_status result
```

The child thread has lineage relationship `subagent` and points back to the
parent node. The parent gets an `app_owned` sub-agent projection and a
sub-agent turn item so the existing debug UI can render progress.

Terminal provider events trigger finalization. The event stream first replays
persisted events and then follows live events, so finalization also runs after
a server restart. An existing `subagent_result` transfer makes finalization
idempotent.

The result summary prefers the latest assistant content from the child run and
falls back to a terminal-status message when no assistant text exists.

## Policy And Idempotency

- A child runtime mode may stay equal to or become narrower than the parent
  mode. It may not escalate privileges.
- A child interaction mode may stay equal to or narrow from `default` to
  `plan`. It may not escalate from `plan` to `default`.
- General thread management is limited to the calling thread's project. Send
  additionally enforces the same runtime and interaction privilege ceiling as
  child creation.
- Provider instances must be enabled, installed, available, authenticated, and
  backed by a V2 adapter.
- A requested model must be advertised by the selected provider when the
  provider publishes a model list.
- `clientRequestId` derives stable command, thread, and message IDs within the
  provider session. Retrying the same call returns the same durable work.
- Calls without `clientRequestId` receive a generated request key and create
  new work.

Expected denials use the typed `OrchestratorMcpFailure` result:

```text
capability_denied
parent_not_active
provider_unavailable
model_unavailable
runtime_mode_escalation_denied
interaction_mode_escalation_denied
task_not_found
task_not_cancellable
thread_not_found
run_not_found
thread_not_sendable
thread_not_interruptible
invalid_request
orchestration_error
```

## Verification

The integration test uses the real MCP toolkit registration, V2 orchestrator,
SQL persistence, event ingestion, projections, and checkpoints. Only the
external provider adapters are deterministic test implementations.

Coverage includes:

- capability discovery;
- cross-provider delegated completion;
- prompt-only child context;
- parent and child lineage projections;
- spawn and result context transfers;
- async status polling;
- cancellation;
- batch ordinary-thread creation;
- project-scoped thread listing and timeline reads;
- ordinary-thread send, wait, steering, and interruption;
- inheritance and per-thread provider overrides; and
- idempotent retries.

Provider adapter tests separately verify Codex, Claude, Cursor, Grok, and ACP
Registry behavior and MCP injection. The provider-session manager test verifies
that credentials exist before an adapter opens and are revoked when it closes.
